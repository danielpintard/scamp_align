# scamp_align
#Formats plain text (.txt) of identifiers and sequences into fasta format. 

In working with Dr. Agolini and Dr. Iyer (Marymount University, Arlington, VA), I was requested to align these SCAMP 1-5 protein coding sequnences to find regions of these sequences that match with each other so that siRNA's can be developed for all of the sequences. These sequences are all from *Mus Musculus*.
