In working with Dr. Agolini and Dr. Iyer (Marymount University, Arlington, VA), I was requested to align these SCAMP 1-5 protein coding sequnences to find regions of these sequences that match with each other so that siRNA's can be developed for all of the sequences. These sequences are all from *Mus Musculus*.

Using CLUSTAL Omega, MSA was conducted with all of the sequences. All sequence motifs amongst the sequences were non-consecutively aligned (ex. ttcac-cc-tg). As the next step in this process, I will be grouping certain sequences together to observe their homology. I aim to produce at most 3 different siRNA target sequences that can be used for all of the SCAMP sequences.
